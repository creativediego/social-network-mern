/**
 *
 * A Mongoose conversation schema that takes an {@link IConversation}. The schema acts as an intermediate document between users and messages. It contains meta data about a conversation between two users or a group conversation, such as type of conversation, who created it, who the participants are, and who has removed/deleted the entire conversation for themselves, which still remains visible to other users.
 *
 * In addition to the native _id created by MongoDb, the conversationId field ensures the conversation document record is unique to avoid duplicating new conversation documents with the same participants. A DAO working with this schema model is responsible for populating the conversationId with a unique identifier that represents all participants in the conversation, perhaps as a sorted concatenated string of all participants _ids.
 * @constructor
 * @param {ConversationType} type the type of this conversation (e.g. PRIVATE or GROUP)
 * @param {Schema.Types.ObjectId} createdBy the user who created the conversation. Ref to {@link UserModel}.
 * @param {Schema.Types.ObjectId} participants the users who are part of this conversation. Ref to {@link UserModel}.
 * @module ConversationSchema
